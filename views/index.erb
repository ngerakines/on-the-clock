<p><strong>On The Clock</strong>is a casual raiding guild working on
achievements, titles and mounts for its members. We raid weekly to work on
achievement completeness for current WOTLK content. Currently we have one 10
man group that raids regularly but are looking to expand into multiple 10-man
groups, 25 man groups and Battleground groups.</p>
<p><strong>What positions do we need to fill?</strong> We are actively
accepting all classes and roles.</p>
<p><strong>What times do you raid?</strong> We raid in the evenings in 2-3 hour
windows on week nights.</p>
<p><strong>How do I join?</strong> Hop onto Lightbringer, do a
`<i>/who on the clock</i>` and ask someone. They will point you in the
right direction.</p>
