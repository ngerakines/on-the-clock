<p><strong>On The Clock</strong> (Alliance, Lightbringer-US) is a casual raiding guild working on achievements, titles and mounts for its members. We raid weekly to work on achievement completeness for current WOTLK content. Currently we have one 10 man group that raids regularly but are looking to expand into multiple 10-man groups, 25 man groups and Battleground groups.</p>
<p><strong>What positions do we need to fill?</strong> We are currently accepting rogues and shamans..</p>
<p><strong>What times do you raid?</strong> We raid in the evenings in 2-3 hour windows on week nights.</p>
